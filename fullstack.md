Hacker News top stories with github authentication

## User Story
Users should be able to sign up in the application using their Github accounts. From the moment a user is logged in behind a protected route, a list of the top stories of hacker news should be presented.

The user should be able to see the details of those stories (number of comments, score and creation date). When the user clicks on the comments' counter, those comments should be presented in the screen without forcing the user to leave the current page.

The stories' list should have a mechanism to perform pagination. When the user picks a story, they should be redirected to that respective story URL.
