# Hacker News

## How to start
Fork this repo so we can start tracking.

## Deadline

There's no deadline, do it in your own time.

## User Story
Users should be able to sign up in your application using Auth0 (username/password or social identity provider). From the moment a user is logged in behind a protected route, a list of the items of hacker news should be presented.

The items should be grouped by type.

The user should be able to see the details of those items according to their type (number of comments, score, options, creation date, and author). When the user clicks on the comments counter, those comments should be presented on the screen without forcing the user to leave the current page.

The items list should have a mechanism to perform pagination. When the user picks an item, they should be redirected to that respective item URL if it exists.

Should be possible to see details about the author.

## Stack and technical requirements
Your frontend should be built using the React paradigm. Other than that, you are free to choose your tech stack.

For your reference, at Pego we're currently using GraphQL, NextJS, ReactNative and TypeScript for frontend, and C# for the backend.

### Requirements

- Frontend should be secured.

- Consider how your frontend tech applies to a mobile app.

- User experience is also evaluated.

### How to deliver your test

After fork, commit your changes in a way that we can clearly evaluate the development process, and don't forget to add a README to help us to understand your project and run it =)
